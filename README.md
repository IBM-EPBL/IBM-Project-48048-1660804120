# Early Prediction of Chronic Kidney diease using Machine Learning 

## Abstract
### Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.

### In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.

### Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.

## Exisiting Problem
### 1.	To measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in adults and children with cystic fibrosis (CF) using a radio-isotope technique as the gold standard and to compare this to serum creatinine based equations, serum cystatin C levels and tobramycin clearance, and to determine which method correlates most closely with measured GFR in this population.

### 2.	The main limitation of the eGFR formulas is significant lack of accuracy in individuals as compared to groups. This causes problems in establishing the presence or absence of early CKD

### 3.	Unfortunately, the initial creatinine tests can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.” Misdiagnoses appear to be common, according to the researchers' review of the electronic health records of 3.8 million emergency and intensive care patients.

## Problem Statement Definition
### Chronic kidney disease includes conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy by filtering wastes from your blood. If kidney disease worsens, wastes can build to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick. You may develop complications like:
•	high blood pressure
•	anemia (low blood count)
•	weak bones
•	poor nutritional health
•	nerve damage

### Kidney disease also increases your risk of having heart and blood vessel disease. These problems may happen slowly over a long time. Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses, it may eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life.

## Proposed Solution
### Chronic Kidney Disease, also known as Chronic Renal Disease, is characterized by abnormal kidney function or a breakdown of renal function that progresses over months or years. Chronic kidney disease is often found during screening of persons who are known to be at ris for kidney issues, such as those wis high blood pressure or diabetes, and those with a blood family who has chronic kidney disease (CKD). As a result, early prognosis is critical in battling the disease and providing effective therapy. Only early identification and continuous monitoring can avoid serious kidney damage or renal failure. Machine Learning (ML) plays a significant part in the healthcare system, and it may efficiently aid and help with decision support in medical institution. The components are built using chronic kidney disease datasets, and the outcomes of these models are compared to select the optimai model for prediction.
